# ðŸ§ª Test Top Skills Fix

## âœ… **Issue Fixed**

The "Top Skills" section in the Dashboard was showing "No skill data available" even when resume reports existed.

### **Root Cause:**
The backend `getDashboardStats` controller was using `Report.getDashboardStats()` which only returned basic statistics without skills aggregation. The `generateDashboardStats` service function existed and properly aggregated skills data, but it wasn't being used.

### **What Was Fixed:**

#### **Backend Changes:**
1. **Updated Controller** (`resumeController.js`):
   - Imported `generateDashboardStats` from `reportGenerator.js`
   - Modified `getDashboardStats` to fetch all reports and use the proper service function
   - Now returns comprehensive stats including `topSkills` array

2. **Enhanced Service** (`reportGenerator.js`):
   - Added `maxFitScore` and `minFitScore` to match the original Report model functionality
   - Added safety checks for skills arrays to prevent errors
   - Ensured consistent data structure

#### **Data Flow:**
```
Frontend Dashboard â†’ API call to /api/resume/dashboard â†’ 
Controller fetches all reports â†’ generateDashboardStats() aggregates skills â†’ 
Returns { topSkills: [{ skill: "JavaScript", count: 5 }, ...] } â†’ 
Frontend renders pie chart with skillData
```

### **How to Test:**
1. Start the application (`npm run dev`)
2. Upload at least 2-3 resumes with different skills
3. Go to Dashboard page
4. Verify the "Top Skills" pie chart now shows:
   - Skills from matched skills across all reports
   - Count of how many reports contain each skill
   - Proper labels and colors
   - No more "No skill data available" message

### **Expected Result:**
The Top Skills section should now display a pie chart showing the most frequent skills across all analyzed resumes, with each skill labeled as "Skill Name (Count)".

### **Files Modified:**
- `AI-Resume-Analyzer/server/src/controllers/resumeController.js`
- `AI-Resume-Analyzer/server/src/services/reportGenerator.js`

### **No Frontend Changes Needed:**
The frontend was already correctly expecting `dashboardStats.topSkills` - the issue was purely on the backend not providing this data.

The fix ensures that skills data is properly aggregated from all reports and made available to the frontend for visualization.
